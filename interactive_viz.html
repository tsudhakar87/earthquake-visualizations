    <h1>Interactive Data Visualizations</h1>
    <h2>Map of All Earthquakes</h2>
    <iframe src="/map final.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
    <p class = "caption">
        This is an interactive plot of every earthquake in the dataset. To interact with the graph, 
        users can use their cursor to move between countries and areas within the world. The user 
        can click on the red icons, which represent an occurrence of an earthquake, to show the year 
        the earthquake occurred, the magnitude of the earthquake, and any recorded deaths. This map 
        shows us where earthquakes are most prevalent around the world, like the eastern side of Africa, 
        the Ring of Fire, and southern China.

    <h2>Earthquake Occurrences & Economic Damage</h2>
    <iframe src="/int_tree_map.html" width="800" height="600" style="text-align:center"></iframe>
    <p class = "caption">
        This treemap visualizes global earthquake counts and economic damages (2000–2024), adjusted to 2024 dollar values for inflation using the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI. It includes 47 countries with complete damage data, showing both direct and indirect costs like infrastructure repairs and healthcare expenses. Box size represents earthquake counts, while color intensity encodes economic damages, with a logarithmic scale addressing skew from Japan’s $449B in damages. Hovering reveals detailed metrics such as damage amounts, earthquake counts, and average magnitudes. The visualization highlights trends, like Japan’s dominance due to frequent high-magnitude events and the 2011 earthquake, while smaller nations like Haiti demonstrate how localized events can have outsized impacts. This treemap underscores the importance of disaster preparedness and the uneven economic toll of earthquakes worldwide.

    <h2>Economic Damage Caused By Earthquakes Over Time</h2>
    <iframe src="/int_bar_chart.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
    <p class = "caption">
        This stacked bar chart shows global earthquake damages (2000–2024) adjusted to 2024 dollar values, highlighting country-specific impacts. Total global damages are shown in gray, with the selected country's damages in red. Hovering provides details, including economic damages, earthquake counts, average magnitude, focal depth, and tsunami occurrences. Japan stands out due to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, causing $300 billion in damages, a tsunami, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster (Daniell, 2011), making it the costliest natural disaster in history. The chart also emphasizes other major events, like China's 2008 Sichuan earthquake, while revealing global patterns of vulnerability and resilience.
