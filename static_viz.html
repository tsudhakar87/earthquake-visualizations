    <h1>Static Data Visualizations</h1>
    <h2>Density Plot</h2>
    <img src="/static_3.png" style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:25%">
    <p class = "intro">
        The graph above represents density plot of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes, which we used to explore the severity of earthquakes. The graph shows that earthquake magnitudes has a slightly bimodal distribution, with peaks around 6.0 and 8.0 in magnitude. In addition, the distribution is relatively narrow, with very little earthquakes being exceptionally low or high in magnitude, so we can deduce that the kurtosis is quite high.

    <h2>Deaths Caused By Earthquakes By Country</h2>

    <p class = "intro">This is a bar chart showing the top ten countries by earthquake deaths. As we can see, China has the most deaths by earthquakes by a wide margin with 651,699. Haiti is second in earthquake deaths, though most of these deaths are due to the deadly 2010 earthquake, suggesting that other earthquakes in Haiti are much less dangerous. Furthermore, seven of these countries are in Asia, suggesting that Asia is the most susceptible continent to earthquakes. Overall, this graph is proof of how dangerous earthquakes are,
        and that they pose a large threat to human safety.</p>
    <h2>Number of Earthquakes Per Year From 1900</h2>
    <img src="/static_img_1.png">
    <p class = "intro">This is a time series plot of earthquake existences since 1900. The occurences of earthquakes appear to be cyclical from 1900 to 2000, which makes sense given the earthquake cycle, which is the phenomeon explaining that earthquakes exist on the same faults repeatedly due to the build up of stress. Around 2000, we see a large jump in earthquake occurrences. This is likely due to the fact that technology to record earthquakes has improved, as smaller earthquakes and earthquakes occurring deeper in the Earth can be recorded. 
        Because of this, we have decided to concentrate our visualizations on this portion of the dataset, since the quality of data is much higher.</p>
