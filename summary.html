    <h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
    <p class = "center">
        Our analysis reveals significant trends and insights into global earthquake occurrences, fatalities, and economic impacts over the past century. 
        Time series data highlight a marked increase in recorded earthquake occurrences since 2000, largely attributed to advances in seismic recording 
        technology. This underscores the importance of focusing on the post-2000 dataset for higher data accuracy. Bar charts and treemaps emphasize 
        the catastrophic human and economic toll of earthquakes, particularly in countries like China, Indonesia, and Japan. China leads in earthquake 
        fatalities due to frequent seismic events and large populations near fault zones, while Haitiâ€™s devastating 2010 earthquake highlights the outsized 
        impact of a single event in vulnerable regions.
        
        Economic analyses show that Japan has suffered the greatest financial losses from earthquakes, driven primarily by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, 
        which caused over $300 billion in damages. Other nations, such as Indonesia and China, also bear significant economic burdens due to their high frequency 
        of earthquakes. Treemaps reveal global disparities, with high-frequency seismic countries like Indonesia experiencing more frequent but lower-magnitude 
        earthquakes, while nations like Japan and Chile endure less frequent but more intense events. This disparity highlights the need for region-specific disaster 
        preparedness and mitigation strategies.

    <h1>Potential Next Inquiries</h1>
    <p class = "center">
        Future research could explore the correlation between urbanization, population density, and earthquake impact severity to better understand how human factors amplify risks. Investigating the effectiveness of seismic-resistant infrastructure in reducing fatalities and economic losses would provide actionable insights for disaster-prone regions. Additionally, studying the impact of earthquake depth and proximity to populated areas on casualties and damages could refine risk assessments and improve early-warning systems. Exploring socio-economic disparities in recovery efforts across different nations may also shed light on the long-term consequences of seismic disasters and guide international support initiatives.
