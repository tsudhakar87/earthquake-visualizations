    <h1>Datasets</h1>
    <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-data " class = "intro">https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-data </a>
    <p class = "intro">We used the National Centers for Environmental Information’s (NCEI) hazardous earthquake dataset, hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This dataset is pretty extensive, with 6,442 entries documenting earthquakes from over 2,000 years ago to the present. Each earthquake is recorded with 39 different details, categorical and continuous, including the exact timing (down to the second), location (latitude and longitude), magnitude, and the impact in terms of deaths, missing persons, injuries, and economic damages. Given the size of this data, after cleaning and filtering the data to fit the 5000 observations and 30 attributes requirement, we’ll be able to analyze when earthquakes happen, how severe they’ve been, and the damage they’ve caused. For example, we can look at trends in fatalities or economic losses across different magnitudes or regions.
        For our project, we’ll be focusing on earthquakes that happened after 1900 to keep things manageable and work with more complete data. We’ll also be cleaning up the dataset to remove entries with too many missing values and dropping columns that aren’t relevant to what we’re analyzing. We also chose this as our data set since it comes from the NCEI, which is part of NOAA, a top authority on environmental data. NCEI has a strong reputation for thorough data collection and validation, so we know the information we’re working with is accurate and reliable.
