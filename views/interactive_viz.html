    <h1>Interactive Data Visualizations</h1>
    <h2>Average Magnitude of Earthquakes by Country</h2>
    <iframe src="/int_tree_map.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
    <p class = "caption">The treemap highlights global earthquake occurrences (2000â€“2024) by country, with box size representing the total number of earthquakes and hover data showing average magnitudes. 
        Countries like China, Indonesia, and Japan dominate with frequent seismic activity, while smaller boxes, such as Panama and Haiti, indicate fewer recorded events. High-frequency countries like 
        China and Indonesia experience frequent but varied-magnitude earthquakes, whereas nations like Japan and Chile endure fewer but more intense events. This visualization 
        underscores the global disparities in earthquake frequency and severity, emphasizing the need for tailored disaster preparedness strategies based on regional seismic activity patterns.

    <h2>Earthquake Occurrences & Economic Damage</h2>
    <iframe src="/int_tree_map2.html" width="800" height="600" style="text-align:center"></iframe>
    <p class = "caption">
        This treemap highlights global earthquake occurrences and economic impacts over the last two decades, with damages adjusted to 2024 values. Box size represents earthquake count, 
        while color intensity reflects total damages influenced by factors like frequency, magnitude, and economic vulnerability. Japan leads with $449B in damages, driven by 
        high-magnitude events and costly impacts on infrastructure, economy, and personal assets. China and Indonesia also face significant damages due to frequent seismic activity. 
        Smaller nations, like Haiti and Samoa, reveal that even fewer earthquakes can have devastating localized effects. The data underscores the importance of tailored disaster 
        preparedness in high-risk regions.

    <h2>Economic Damage Caused By Earthquakes Over Time</h2>
    <iframe src="/int_bar_chart.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
    <p class = "caption">
        This graph shows earthquake damages by country from 2000 to 2024, adjusted to 2024 values. Japan dominates due to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the costliest natural 
        disaster in history, causing over $300 billion in damages, a devastating tsunami, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster (Daniell, James, 2011). Countries like Indonesia and China 
        also exhibit significant impacts from recurring earthquakes. The graph underscores the global economic toll of earthquakes, where both large-scale disasters and localized events, 
        such as those in smaller nations like Haiti and Italy, collectively contribute to substantial losses over time.
