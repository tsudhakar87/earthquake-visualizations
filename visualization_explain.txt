Treemap:
“Global Earthquake Counts and Economic Damages by Country (2000–2024)” 

This treemap highlights global earthquake counts and economic damages from 2000 to 2024, adjusted 
to 2024 dollar values using the formula: Adjusted Damage = Total Damage × (Current CPI / Event Year 
CPI). This adjustment standardizes economic impacts across years, accounting for inflation using the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI. The dataset originally included 109 countries, but only 47 had 
complete economic damage data, making this visualization representative of those countries. Economic 
damages encompass both direct and indirect costs, such as infrastructure repairs, agricultural losses, 
healthcare expenses, and road reconstruction.

The treemap effectively uses marks (rectangular areas) to represent countries and channels to encode 
earthquake counts (box size) and economic damages (color intensity). A logarithmic scale was applied to 
the color axis to address the data skew caused by Japan’s $449B in damages, which would otherwise dominate 
the visualization. The "reds" color palette intuitively conveys the severity of damages, as red is 
universally associated with danger and negative impact. Users can hover over boxes to access detailed 
metrics, including exact economic damages, earthquake counts, average magnitude, focal depth, and tsunami 
occurrences, or click on specific countries for focused exploration. By illustrating the interplay between 
frequency, magnitude, and economic vulnerability, this treemap reveals global trends. For example, Japan’s 
high costs are driven by frequent high-magnitude events and significant infrastructure damage, while smaller 
nations like Haiti demonstrate how even a few earthquakes can lead to devastating localized impacts. This 
visualization emphasizes the critical need for tailored disaster preparedness strategies and highlights the 
disproportionate economic burdens faced by smaller, less resilient nations.


Stacked bar chart:
"Earthquake Economic Damage in <GIVEN COUNTRY> Compared to Global Totals by Year"

This stacked bar chart visualizes earthquake damages by country from 2000 to 2024, adjusted to 2024 dollar values. 
Marks used are bars: gray bars represent total global damages per year, while red bars highlight the selected 
country's damages. Channels include color to differentiate the selected country (red) from total damages (gray) 
and bar size to encode economic losses. Hovering over gray bars reveals total economic damage and earthquake count 
for the year, while hovering over the selected country's bars provides detailed statistics: economic damage, earthquake 
count, average magnitude, focal depth, and tsunami occurrences.

The chart highlights how specific countries, particularly Japan, dominate earthquake-related damages. Japan’s prominence 
stems from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, which caused over $300 billion in damages, a tsunami, and the Fukushima 
nuclear disaster, making it the costliest natural disaster in history (Daniell, James, 2011). Other major events include 
the 2008 Sichuan earthquake in China, which devastated rural areas with inadequate seismic infrastructure. Users can 
select countries to compare their damages to global totals, providing insights into which countries were most affected 
each year.

The chart reveals that while economic damages show a general downward trend, this may not necessarily reflect fewer 
earthquake events but rather improved infrastructure resilience. The recurring activity in Japan aligns with its position 
on the Ring of Fire, where four tectonic plates converge. The visualization offers a focused view compared to the 
global treemap, emphasizing both major disasters like Japan's 2011 earthquake and localized impacts, such as Haiti's 
events, which highlight disparities in vulnerability and resilience globally.
